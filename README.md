# LLMs in production

In this two-week course you’ll build a production‑ready SQL code generation tool with LLMs. 
- **Week 1** covers prompt engineering for SQL translation, model evaluation and safety guardrails to ensure accurate, secure outputs.
- **Week 2** focuses on performance tuning—implementing semantic caching, user feedback loops and monitoring pipelines—and defensive UX design that gracefully handles errors.

By the end, you’ll master end‑to‑end LLM app development: from crafting prompts and enforcing output quality to optimizing latency, cost and user experience. These skills prepare you to lead GenAI projects, delivering scalable, reliable and cost‑effective solutions across any data‑driven organization.
